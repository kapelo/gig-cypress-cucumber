# GIG Code Challenge

This is a solution to a code challenge for GIG.

## Assumptions
I am not expected to complete the checkout process for task 2.

## Difficulties Encountered
Figuring out how to work with texts derived from elements was initially difficult since I was using Cypress for the first time. Going through the Cypress documentation helped with overcoming that difficulty.

### Install
